# Clone-amazon.com
A front-end clone of Amazon.com built using HTML and CSS, replicating the layout, design, and responsiveness of the original website.

# Amazon Clone (Home Page)
This project is a clone of the Amazon homepage designed using **HTML** and **CSS**. The layout mimics the core features of Amazon's homepage, showcasing various product categories and navigation elements. High-quality images are sourced from **Unsplash** to represent product categories, giving the site a polished and visually appealing look.

## Features:
- **Homepage Design**: The homepage replicates key sections of the Amazon site, including the navigation bar, product categories, and promotional banners.
- **Category Sections**: Categories such as "Accessories," "Home Essentials," "Fashion," and more are visually displayed with background images fetched from **Unsplash**. Each section has a "See More" link that is currently a placeholder for future functionality.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout is designed to adjust and fit different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices (though no media queries are implemented as of now).
- **Navigation and Footer**: A fully functional header with search functionality, sign-in options, and a footer with links to Amazon's informational pages. The footer is organized into panels for easy access.
- **Interactive Elements**: Basic hover effects and clickable links improve the user interface experience. Some links, like "See More," are set as placeholders for future pages.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout, including Flexbox and Box Model techniques.
- **Unsplash API**: For fetching high-quality images to visually represent different product categories.
- **VS Code**: Code editor used for development.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and project management.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deploying the static site online.

## Future Enhancements:
- Implement media queries to enhance mobile responsiveness.
- Replace placeholder "See More" links with actual links to category pages or implement JavaScript for dynamic content loading.
- Add interactivity such as product carousels, modals, and a shopping cart.
